# Rice University Thesis Template (2026 Version)

**A clean, modern LaTeX template for Rice University PhD and Master's theses.**

This is a "hard fork" and modernization of the [legacy Rice LaTeX template](https://github.com/DaoWen/rice-thesis-latex), compatible with **XeLaTeX** engine, enabling support for system fonts, proper Unicode (including optional CJK characters), and compressed citation indices via **BibLaTeX**.

## 🛠️ Usage

### Option 1: Overleaf (Recommended)
1.  Find this project on Overleaf Templates.
2.  **Crucial Step:** Click the **Menu** button (top-left).
3.  Change **Compiler** from `pdfLaTeX` to **`XeLaTeX`**.
4.  Click **Recompile**.

### Option 2: Local Installation
You need a TeX distribution (TeX Live, MacTeX, or MiKTeX) installed. We recommend using `latexmk` to automate the build process.

**Build Command:**
```bash
latexmk -xelatex main.tex
```

**Clean Build Files:**
```bash
latexmk -c
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Class Options
You can pass options to the document class in `main.tex`:

```latex
% Standard setup
\documentclass[12pt]{ruthesis}

% Enable CJK font support (requires Fandol fonts or system fonts)
\documentclass[cjk]{ruthesis}

% Disable citation compression (e.g., show [1], [2] instead of [1-2])
\documentclass[nocompress]{ruthesis}
```

### Thesis Metadata
Edit the `main.tex` file to set your personal information. The template handles the formatting automatically.

```latex
\title{Your Thesis Title}
\author{Your Name}
\department{Physical and Astronomy}
\degree{Doctor of Philosophy}
% ... see main.tex for Committee members
```
